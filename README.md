This is a test project to create a simple MVC solution with an example of admin panel for e-commerce.

It works with PHP 5.5+ and MySQL with PDO_MYSQL for PHP enabled.

 - Dependency Injection with using of Type Hinting   
 - Error Handling

 - Models With setters and getters to work with a single record
 - Repositories to work with sets of records
